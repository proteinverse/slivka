Changelog:

## [0.8.5] - (upcoming)

- Added: support for Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13
- Fixed: logging configuration crashing on Python 3.12.
- Fixed: invalid file path resolution when the path contained symlinks and the
  SLIVKA_HOME was provided explicitly.
- Updated: transition from using *distutils* to *packaging* for package version
  information.
- Added: database documents tests
- Fixed: missing status entries in job status cache for up to 5 seconds after
  new jobs are submitted. Now, every time a new job is submitted, the cache is
  invalidated.
- Fixed: API responses involving result file return actual location of the
  resource instead of the path inferred form the job id
- Changed: the flat structire of job directories is changed into a tree with
  the first two levels consisting of the counter part of the object id and
  the last level of the remaining part.
- Changed: bumped the version of werkzeug library used
- Fixed: explicitly defined pytest.marks used in tests internally
- Added: migration tool converting old project structure to the new one
- Changed: ShellRunner spawns a subprocess instead of running the command in a
  default shell which caused issues with some command line tools.

- Changed: prefix middleware no longer squashes repeating slashes.
- Changed: prefix middleware removes single trailing slash in prefix.
- Fixed: tests of prefix middleware.
- Changed: the choice field only allows the keys of the `choices` mapping as
  valid input values.
- Changed: the JSON response for job resource contains the choice keys instead
  of values for choice inputs.
- Changed: name of the settings file changed to *settings.yaml* from
  *config.yaml* in the documentation.

## [0.8.3b3] - 2024-08-08

- Added: argument constants can be specified in the runner definition and
  applied conditionally to the command line when that runner is selected.
- Added: additional environment variables can be specified in the runner

  current time.
- Changed: switched to python-daemon library for managing daemons and pid
